# SoS_FoMT-Profit_Calculator
This is my first code. It tells you how profitable each culture can be at the end of each season in 
Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town.

It sure can become obsolete quite quicly if I just store the results in a file since the game is an enclosed universe 
with little variables, but I want to use this project as something on which I can exercise the knowladge I acquire 
while learning to code.

If you have any tips, be my guest to make suggestions :)
